\section{Discussion}
There is a lot of things that would be crucial to add but for which the time was not enough. One important thing is the fact that for now, the \lstinline{owner} field on resources is underutilized. The fact of the matter is that only in the login and logout stages authenticity is ensured but the sharing procedure does not verify ownership. This means that Bob could theoretically share any folder that Alice shares with him which is not optimal. We discussed this issue briefly in class, I think the most important aspect is trust between Alice and Bob. Mechanically, such an insurance could only be possible if Bob did not have "copyright" over the shared content. He could read it, modify it but not copy it and share it. This is a legal matter though because as long as it is made of ones and zeroes, it can be copied. Additionally, a way for Bob to be able to write the data that is being shared with him would also be interesting. This procedure was explained in previous sections. 

A big lack my framework has is the ability of interacting with it. For now it only provides tools and a brief demonstration of each implemented procedure. A real interface would have been ideal however out of scope it may be for this project.
