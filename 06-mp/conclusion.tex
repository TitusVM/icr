\section{Conclusion}
The framework provides four different procedures of handling file system interactions. The main server unit will not get into contact with sensitive information. The procedures implemented and demonstrated are an account creation procedure, a login procedure, a password change procedure and finally a sharing procedure allowing two users to exchange private folders between each other. In my implementation, I cannot see a way for an attacker to get around a difficult problem and it seems that even if a total server leak occurs, unless something was not properly encrypted when it was uploaded, no data should be visible. Even a password dictionary attack would not result in any good solution, the password salt would be provided by the server for anyone but there is still the slow argon2 process to overcome before being able to test a password's validity. Again, the server would also be able to notice repeated challenge requests and block attackers accordingly, this is a well-known security measure.
