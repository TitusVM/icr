\section{Architecture}
\subsection{Web Server}

\begin{minipage}{0.44\textwidth}
    A web server is an online machine that serves clients. Its purpose can be manifold. In our project, this web server will store files for users. They may connect to the server using some credentials (in our case a unique username and a password) and have access to their files as well as the files that have been shared with them by other users. In \autoref{fig:generalarchi} we outlined the general architecture of the server. The server prompts the client for credentials, the client provides them, the server can then verify the credentials and grant access to the storage. In this way, the client can connect from anywhere and on any device, without having to transport the entire storage. This is essentially what is commonly referred to as a cloud storage service.

The standard procedure to interact with the server is outlined in \autoref{fig:generalinteract}. As depicted, there are four components that need to be conceptualized.

\subsection{Storage}

\begin{minipage}{1\textwidth}
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering
        \includesvg[inkscapelatex=false]{resources/file_system.svg}
        \caption{\label{fig:filesystem} A basic filesystem }
    \end{figure}
\end{minipage}

The building blocks for a simple file system are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Folders are containers for other folders and files.
    \item Files are bundles of information.
    \item A root folder is the root node of the hierarchy that illustrates the file system. In \autoref{fig:filesystem} the root folder is the left most folder.
\end{itemize}

Storage is handled by a server module which implements all the necessary tools for our model. It also provides types corresponding to the architecture we described above. The file structure is composed of a file name, an owner and some content. Added to the simple structure is a "signature" field, it will be crucial for ensuring trust in the provenance and the integrity of the file, more on that later. Secondly, the folder structure, in addition to name, owner and signature it also contains a list of folders, and a list of files.

\subsubsection{Storage encryption}
The filesystem is stored on a server. In this project, the server is exposed to active adversaries which means that the filesystem must be fully encrypted. The constraints of the project allow for the filesystem's hierarchy to leak which means that only file contents, file and folder names as well as owners must be encrypted. The signature must also be encrypted, this may seem strange but if this weren't the case, an attacker could potentially try all public keys on a resource until the signature verification algorithm verifies the given public key. This would tell the attacker who signed the file they just verified and that, in addition to the hierarchy being public, may lead to unique id leakage, linking unique ids to usernames. Each folder additionally contains two separate lists: a list containing each folder's (that is inside the current folder) symmetric key and a list containing each file's (also contained in the current folder) symmetric key. These are used to encrypt and decrypt the files. 

Because only the owner of a root folder on the server should be able to access all the contents of their root folder, symmetric encryption seems to be the ideal choice. It also provides no way for an active adversary to sneak between the user and the server to eavesdrop on the communication or perform a man in the middle attack. Symmetric encryption dictates that a single master key encrypts the root folder

To achieve symmetric encryption on this scale, we use a password. This password is not stored on the server. The user must remember it well. The password will be digested client-side to create a password hash. This hash can be used for two processes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item First, the login challenge. 
    \item Second, the fetching of the encrypted root folder (containing all their files).
\end{itemize}
The process is divided into two separate processes to make it impossible for an attacker to get a free offline version of the encrypted resources. If there were no challenge and since we do not store passwords on the server, we would immediately send back the encrypted root folder without authenticating the user. Therefore, an attacker has an offline version of the encrypted root folder and can perform brute-force attacks without us ever knowing. The two parts will be explained in detail in the next section.

\begin{minipage}{1\textwidth}
    \begin{figure}[H]

        \includesvg[inkscapelatex=false, scale=0.9]{resources/model_sequence.svg}
        \caption{\label{fig:sequence_model} The sequence of our model  }
    \end{figure}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Authentication}
The authentication part of the model relies on the User structure. A user can be created and added to the server's user list. When creating a user, we must also create its root folder which must be provided when adding the user to the server. This root folder carries the unique user id as a name and is therefore closely related to this user. We are willing to make unique identifiers public because they are nothing more than basic resource locators so we don't mind leaking them. No information can be extracted from them.
\subsubsection{Root folder decryption and encryption}
The sequence in \autoref{fig:sequence_model}\footnote{It's important to note that the Root context in this diagram represents the root repository of the system. This means that all root folders (one per user) are stored within it.} shows the basic operation of the filesystem. Once a user has been created and provided to the server with a root folder, an additional challenge hash is required to make the two-step authentication possible. The user is not aware of this two-step process, he only witnesses the credential providing step and the receiving of data or failing (indicated by the red path).

The challenge hash is required because it allows us to avoid storing passwords or their hashes on the server. This means that the server is never in contact with something directly derived from the password or more crucially, the password itself. The whole process of creating a user by providing root folder and a challenge hash ensures this ignorance.

If the challenge succeeds, the user receives the encrypted root folder adding an additional layer of security. An attacker would have to first break the secure channel linking user and server to then only receive encrypted data for which he would have to brute-force a password or a password hash. To log out, the user can simply encrypt the root folder and send it back to the server. Should he choose to change passwords, he has to provide a new challenge hash when sending back the encrypted root folder. 

\subsection{Sharing}
Each resource on the file system is encrypted with a key. This means that folders do not only contain other folders and some files, but they also contain two lists of keys. One list for the folders, the other for the files. Therefore, when a user decrypts their root folder, it recursively decrypts all folders contained within and all files in those folders using the two lists of keys. Each entry in the lists is a key-value pair where the key is the name of the folder or file and, confusingly, the value is the corresponding encryption key. Crucially, these lists are encrypted using the folder's key which contains them. 

To share resources (folders or files), Alice must be their owner. Bob, who she wants to share folder A with, has an asymmetric key pair, a public and private one. Alice logs into the system, decrypts her root folder and notes the name of the folder she wishes to share with Bob, folder A. She is going to encrypt folder A with Bob's public key and send the result to Bob. Theoretically, this exchange could be intercepted and toyed with, which is why it's important to add an authenticating tag on that payload, in the form of a signature (encrypt-then-sign) for instance. We add a signature here, because the shared resource and its integrated signature (signing the content of the resource and not the current message) are encrypted. Bob wants to be able to verify the authenticity of a message he receives without having to decrypt it, adding an additional signature allows him to do just that. Additionally, keeping the resource's signature allows for unencrypted authenticated sharing. This could be useful for a publicly available resource that still requires authentication. Everyone would be able to access the resource and verify its authenticity.

It is important to note that the encryption and signing processes use two separate key pairs. A signing key pair for signatures and an encryption key pair. 

\subsubsection{On write access}
In a future implementation it could be interesting to have a mechanic of allowing Bob, with whom Alice shared a resource, to modify that resource. In our implementation, because we do not store unencrypted resources on the server, Bob would need to encrypt the shared resource with Alice's public key, sign it and send it back to her so she can verify the changes and upload them to her root folder after encryption. This way, should Alice not want Bob's changes, she could simply refuse them. This would probably also require some sort of version control to make sure that conflicts are dealt with and not simply overwritten. This exchange is displayed in the sequence diagram on \autoref{fig:sequence_share}, however, it has not been implemented.

\begin{minipage}{1\textwidth}
    \begin{figure}[H]

        \includesvg[inkscapelatex=false, scale=0.9]{resources/sharing_sequence.svg}
        \caption{\label{fig:sequence_share} The sequence of the sharing process for users Alice and Bob with key pairs (A, a) and (B, b) the capital letters being the public keys }
    \end{figure}
\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{On access revocation}
In our architecture, revocation is not possible. This is because Bob only gets an "offline" version of our folder. There is no additional interaction between Bob and the server after he receives the share from Alice. This means that for revocation to be possible we would need to add some sort of certificate chain to the folder and rethink the folder access. This way we may be able to simply add Bob's verified certificate to the resource we want to share (we play the role of certificate authority for our own resources) allowing him to get various types of permissions on the shared folder.
